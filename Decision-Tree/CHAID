CHAID creates decision trees by:

1. Splitting data based on the most significant independent variable (feature).
2. Using **Chi-Square** test to determine how much a feature influences the target.
3. Creating **branches** for each category of the chosen feature.
4. Repeating until no significant split is found.

### 🧠 **Why Use CHAID?**

* Works great with **categorical data**.
* **Multi-way splits** (not limited to binary like ID3/CART).
* Built-in **statistical significance testing**.
* Good for **marketing, survey analysis, risk prediction**, etc.

## 📘 **Steps in CHAID Algorithm**

1. **Start with all data at the root node.**
2. For each **predictor (feature)**:

   * Group categories together that **aren’t significantly different** based on **Chi-square test**.
3. Select the feature with the **smallest p-value** (most significant).
4. **Split** the node into branches based on the selected feature’s categories.
5. **Repeat** the process recursively for each child node until:

   * No predictor has a significant association,
   * Node becomes pure,
   * Or stopping criteria is met (like depth, min samples, etc.)

## 🔢 **Chi-Square Test Formula**

For feature `X` and target `Y`, the test checks:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

Where:

* $O_i$ = Observed frequency
* $E_i$ = Expected frequency

Smaller **p-values** from Chi-square = **Stronger relation** → better feature for split.

## 🔧 Python (Basic CHAID-like simulation using `pandas`, `scipy`)

```python
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# Sample data
data = {
    'Weather': ['Sunny', 'Rainy', 'Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Rainy', 'Overcast', 'Overcast', 'Rainy'],
    'Play': ['No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Chi-Square test between 'Weather' and 'Play'
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(df['Weather'], df['Play'])

chi2, p, dof, ex = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

print("Contingency Table:\n", contingency_table)
print("\nChi-square Value:", chi2)
print("P-Value:", p)

if p < 0.05:
    print("✅ Significant relationship between Weather and Play")
else:
    print("❌ No significant relationship found.")
```

## 🔍 Output Interpretation:

If **p-value < 0.05**, then `Weather` is statistically significant → Use it for branching.

## 🧬 CHAID vs Other Decision Trees

| Feature         | CHAID                | CART/ID3           |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Splits          | Multi-way            | Binary             |
| Feature type    | Categorical (mostly) | Both cat & numeric |
| Splitting logic | Chi-square           | Gini/Entropy       |
| Purpose         | Stats-oriented       | Accuracy-oriented  |

# 📈 Regression Line

A **Regression Line** is a straight line that best fits the data points on a scatter plot, showing the relationship between two variables.  
It is widely used in **statistics** and **machine learning** to make predictions.

## 🔹 Definition
A regression line represents the relationship between an **independent variable (X)** and a **dependent variable (Y)**.  
The general equation of a regression line is:

\[
Y = mX + c
\]

Where:
- **Y** = Dependent variable (predicted value)  
- **X** = Independent variable  
- **m** = Slope of the line  
- **c** = Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)

## 🔹 Steps to Find the Regression Line
1. Collect dataset with input (X) and output (Y).  
2. Plot data points on a graph.  
3. Apply the **Least Squares Method** to minimize the sum of squared errors.  
4. Derive slope (m) and intercept (c).  

Formulas:  
\[
m = \frac{N\sum XY - \sum X \sum Y}{N\sum X^2 - (\sum X)^2}
\]

\[
c = \frac{\sum Y - m \sum X}{N}
\]

## 🔹 Example
Suppose we have the following data:

| X | Y |
|---|---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 5 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |

Using regression formulas, we can calculate **m** and **c** to form the regression line equation.
